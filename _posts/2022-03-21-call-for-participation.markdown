With the entry into force of the Cybersecurity Security Act, a Cybersecurity certification is becoming a crucial factor for businesses success, specially for SMEs in charge of ICT products, services or processes. The Cybersecurity certification based on risk evaluation and treatment (CORAL), an opensource project, is being established to address this lack on the market. One of the key objectives of the project is to set up the building blocks of self-assessment and certification for the basic level assurance in line with the EU Cybersecurity Act. 

This call for participation is part of the feasibility study stage of the project which aims to evaluate not only the market assimilation for the basic level of assurance and conformity self-assessment but also to assess the selected approach and methodology.  

Your participation would provide the project team with a valuable independent feedback , in order to have a user friendly certification process that meets as many market needs and requirements as possible. Volunteers to the feasibility study would be  invited to provide feedback:

* on the proposed certification process;
* on the designed questions for the self-assessment and the basic level of assurance;
* on the technical considerations;
* on any hypothesis made.

Your participation in this project is on voluntary basis and will not be financially compensated. However, your contributions would be recognized and published on the project website, if your consent is given. By participating in this project, you would actively engage in various discussions around the certification, and gain a head-start in terms of the first CSA-based EU-cybersecurity certification framework for the basic level of assurance.

All volunteers are expected to contribute from September 2022 to February 2023. If you are willing to take part, kindly contact us via our email address at [coral@cases.lu](mailto:coral@lhc.lu?subject=Coral%20Project%20Call%20for%20Participation)
