# Disseminating our project in Luxembourg

ICT Spring is one of the most prominent yearly events in Luxembourg in the area of technology and innovation. Participants to ICT Spring range from decision makers, to startups, researchers and venture capitalists. 

We were happy that our CORAL project and its results were presented in the demo area of ICT Spring on June 30th!
