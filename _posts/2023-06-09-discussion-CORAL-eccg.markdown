We are happy to discuss CORAL and its approach at the ECCG meeting today. ECCG stands for European Cybersecurity Certification Group and is composed of representatives of national cybersecurity certification authorities or representatives of other relevant national authorities. Among other responsibilities, ECCG can also examine developments in the field of cybersecurity certification and help exchange information and good practices on cybersecurity certification schemes.
