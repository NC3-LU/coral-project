# All promotional videos for CORAL are out!

A picture says a thousand words but a video, a thousand times more! 

As promised in the project planning phase, the CORAL consortium has prepared several video materials giving an overview of what the project and its results are about. 

We have 2 CORAL-related videos that we invite you to watch:

# For whom the videos are intended
   
Just like the event organised in October, our videos aim to reach to a wide audience, including: 

* SMEs that are unsure of the advantages of standards and certification in cybersecurity,
* auditors that could perform certifications in the context of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA),
* specific authorities that can play a role in the accreditation and certification proceeses in the scope of the CSA, 
* the wider public, concerned about cybersecurity, who consumes or uses ICT solutions.
