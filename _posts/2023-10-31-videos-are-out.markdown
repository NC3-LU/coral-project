# For whom the videos are intended
   
Just like the event organised in October, our videos aim to reach to a wide audience, including: 

* SMEs that are unsure of the advantages of standards and certification in cybersecurity,
* auditors that could perform certifications in the context of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA),
* specific authorities that can play a role in the accreditation and certification proceeses in the scope of the CSA, 
* the wider public, concerned about cybersecurity, who consumes or uses ICT solutions.
