CORAL’s proof of concept has materialised in its first version!

Fit4CSA is aimed at any SME that wishes to assess if an ICT process, service or application can be certified at a basic level in the context of the Cybersecurity Act. The respondent can pick one of the 4 
questionnaires, that are all based on existing assessment schemes ([EUCS](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme) or, if an assessment scheme is not yet proposed, a standard or best practice 
ranging from OWASP’s to ISO/IEC 21827:2008. After filling in the questionnaire in an anonymous way, the respondent is given a score and a set of recommendations, if the answers were not optimal. These 
recommendations can serve to improve the cybersecurity maturity of the object to be assessed. If the score achieved is high enough, the respondent can either opt for obtaining a report serving as the basis of 
a conformity self-assessment, or can continue the process by registering and requesting an audit based on the answers to the questionnaire.
