CORAL, which stands for **cybersecurity Certification based On Risk evALuation and treatment**, is a project with the objective to set up the building blocks of self-assessment and certification for the basic level of assurance in line with the EU Cybersecurity Act, or CSA (Regulation EU 2019/881). CSA became effective in June 2019 and offers businesses the opportunity to certify that their products or services meet EU cybersecurity standards.

CORAL was awarded EU funding under the [2020 CEF Telecom Call](https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2020-cybersecurity). Even if CORAL was launched in a Luxembourgish context, its aim is ambitious: to become known and used in Luxembourg but as much as possible also abroad. Its target audience is primarily small and medium enterprises who have a product or service to sell, and wish to assess (by themselves or by means of hiring external auditors) that basic cybersecurity requirements are respected regarding their service or product. 

CORAL’s first kickoff meeting concluded successfully on the 16th of September and the first activities have started smoothly. 

Stay tuned for the next updates!
